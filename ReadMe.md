# CS50W: Web Development with Django and JavaScript

This repository contains all the code challenges, assignments, and practice work completed as part of the CS50W: Web Development with Django and JavaScript course offered by Harvard University.

## Course Overview

- JavaScript for client-side interactivity
- APIs and data integration
- User authentication and security
- Deployment and scaling

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into separate folders for each project or assignment, along with additional directories for general practice and code challenges. Here's a breakdown of the structure:


- `project1/`, `project2/`, etc.: Directories containing the code and resources for individual course projects or assignments.
- `lecture_notes/`: This directory contains notes taken during the course lectures.
- `code_challenges/`: Here you'll find solutions to various coding challenges and exercises provided throughout the course.
- `practice/`: This directory includes practice files, experiments, and personal coding exercises related to the course materials.

## Usage

Each project or assignment directory contains its own README file with instructions on how to set up and run the code. Additionally, you may find relevant documentation or notes within the individual directories.

To get started with a specific project or assignment, navigate to the corresponding directory and follow the instructions in the README file.
